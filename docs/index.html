<p>
    Hey! I am Mariusz, a freelance web developer
</p>
<p>
    Currently situated in London, United Kingdom I work with clients across the globe to provide efficient, cutting
    edge solutions.
</p>
<h3>Passion</h3>
<p>
    Gardening, exercise, reading, and drawing are just a few of my hobbies. A wide range of activities helps
    keep my life interesting. I take a hands on approach with anything that interests me.
</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>
    HTML/CSS are my bread and butter, the rest of the sandwich comes from my knowledge of JavaScript,
    PHP, Node.Js, MySql, and a plethora of front-end frameworks.
